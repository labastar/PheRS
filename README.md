# PheRS

There are two R-scripts included in this project:

1.) PheRS code.R
This R script reads in a file with icd9 codes for a cohort of individuals and generates a PheRS phenotype file for 1201 diseases based on OMIM clinical descriptions. Random sample data is included in the icd9s_sample_data.txt. The file saved at the end of the script is formatted as a Plink phenotype file.

2.) PheRS_Grid.R
This script creates a grid visualization for a set of individuals (set in the script as IDs_for_grid) in a cohort with icd9 codes for the PheRS based on an OMIM disease (set in the script as dID_for_grid). icd9s_sample_data.txt contains random icd9 data to try the script. The end result is a plot generated by a function from the pheatmap package.
