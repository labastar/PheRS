# PheRS

This R script reads in a file of icd9 codes for a cohort of individuals and generates a PheRS phenotype file for 1201 diseases based on OMIM clinical descriptions.

Random sample data is included in the file icd9s_sample_data.txt. 

The file saved at the end of the script is formatted as a Plink phenotype file.
